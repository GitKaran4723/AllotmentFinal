# BCA External Examiner Allotment System

## Overview
This project is developed by the students of BCA at Bangalore University (BU). It aims to streamline the allotment of external examiners for BCA lab exams across colleges under BU. The system ensures fair distribution of examiners based on multiple parameters like residential address, college location, and the number of students.

## Features
1. **Data Collection Module** - Gather faculty details and availability.
2. **Update Faculty Availability** - Teachers can update their availability status.
3. **Smart Allotment** - Assign external examiners based on:
   - Residential address (using the pincode of colleges and faculties).
   - Number of students in the college.
4. **Contribution Tracking** - Maintain records of colleges contributing faculties as examiners.
5. **Performance Analysis** - Identify best-performing colleges in this regard.
6. **Daily Updates** - Monitor faculty availability in real-time.
7. **Visit Records** - Enable colleges to log the time of visit of external examiners.
8. **Non-Contributing Colleges** - Track colleges that avoid sending faculties as examiners.
